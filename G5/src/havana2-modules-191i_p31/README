Player 2 (INT_191)
=================

Introduction
------------

Player 2 is a thorough redesign of the successful Player 1 architecture 
currently deployed as the playback engine for digital video recorders 
and media centres.

Player 2 revisits many of the design decisions of Player 1 modernizing 
the architecture thus making is suitable for demanding applications 
such as BD-ROM playback and A/V receiver while retaining the features 
required to support traditional media centres.

Among the faults with player 1 are:

 * There is one player 1 instantiation per playback (you may not have 
   noticed this if you have only one TV).

 * Buffers carry no context (without fudging a header at the start).

 * There is no way to flush instructions or operations down the 
   decoding pipeline.

 * The avsync control is based around operations on frames of data.

 * There is no mechanism to import, or export the playback time and 
   consequently no way to synchronise external events with the playback.

 * There is no way to dispose of a buffer out of line.

Player 2 is expected to address these and other issues, among the key 
changes to player 2 are:

 * There is only one player instantiation, with multiple ongoing 
   playbacks.

 * There is a more sophisticated buffer mechanism, based around a class 
   implementation, and supporting reference counts and meta data 
   attachment etc...

 * Input is via a buffer, and can be multiplexed or de-multiplexed.

 * We can support the passing of instructions/parameters down the 
   buffer chain.

 * Avsync is based around providing a preferred manifestation time for 
   every frame of audio/video, alongside an expected duration (to allow 
   video drivers, for example, to decide how long the top field of an 
   interlaced frame should be on display).

 * We have added functions to import and export time in its 
   multiple forms.
