Kernel Memory Leak Detector
===========================


Introduction
------------

Kmemleak provides a way of detecting possible kernel memory leaks in a
way similar to a tracing garbage collector
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29#Tracing_garbage_collectors),
with the difference that the orphan pointers are not freed but only
reported via /sys/kernel/debug/memleak. A similar method is used by
the Valgrind tool (memcheck --leak-check) to detect the memory leaks
in user-space applications.


Usage
-----

CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK has to be enabled. For additional config options,
look in:

 -> Kernel hacking
 -> Kernel debugging
 -> Debug slab memory allocations
 -> Kernel memory leak detector

To display the possible memory leaks:

 # mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug/
 # cat /sys/kernel/debug/memleak

In order to reduce the run-time overhead, memory scanning is only
performed when reading the /sys/kernel/debug/memleak file.


Basic Algorithm
---------------

The memory allocations via kmalloc, vmalloc, kmem_cache_alloc and
friends are tracked and the pointers, together with additional
information like size and stack trace, are stored in a radix tree. The
corresponding freeing function calls are tracked and the pointers
removed from the radix tree.

An allocated block of memory is considered orphan if a pointer to its
start address or to an alias (pointer aliases are explained later)
cannot be found by scanning the memory (including saved
registers). This means that there might be no way for the kernel to
pass the address of the allocated block to a freeing function and
therefore the block is considered a leak.

The scanning algorithm steps:

 1. mark all pointers as white (remaining white pointers will later
 be considered orphan)
 2. scan the memory starting with the data section and stacks,
 checking the values against the addresses stored in the radix
 tree. If a white pointer is found, it is added to the grey list
 3. scan the grey pointers for matching addresses (some white
 pointers can become grey and added at the end of the grey list)
 until the grey set is finished
 4. the remaining white pointers are considered orphan and reported
 via /sys/kernel/debug/memleak


Improvements
------------

Because the Linux kernel calculates many pointers at run-time via the
container_of macro (see the lists implementation), a lot of false
positives would be reported. This tool re-writes the container_of
macro so that the offset and type information is stored in the
.init.memleak_offsets section. The memleak_init() function creates a
radix tree with corresponding offsets for every encountered block
type. The memory allocations hook stores the pointer address together
with its aliases based on the type of the allocated block.

While one level of offsets should be enough for most cases, a second
level, i.e. container_of(container_of(...)), can be enabled via the
configuration options (one false positive is the "struct socket_alloc"
allocation in the sock_alloc_inode() function).

Some allocated memory blocks have pointers stored in the kernel's
internal data structures and they cannot be detected as orphans. To
avoid this, kmemleak can also store the number of values equal to the
pointer (or aliases) that need to be found so that the block is not
considered a leak. One example is __vmalloc().


Limitations and Drawbacks
-------------------------

The biggest drawback is the reduced performance of memory allocation
and freeing. To avoid other penalties, the memory scanning is only
performed when the /sys/kernel/debug/memleak file is read. Anyway,
this tool is intended for debugging purposes where the performance
might not be the most important requirement.

Kmemleak currently approximates the type id using the sizeof()
compiler built-in function. This is not accurate and can lead to false
negatives. The aim is to gradually change the kernel and kmemleak to
do more precise type identification.

Another source of false negatives is the data stored in non-pointer
values. Together with the more precise type identification, kmemleak
could only scan the pointer members in the allocated structures.

The tool can report false positives. These are cases where an
allocated block doesn't need to be freed (some cases in the init_call
functions), the pointer is calculated by other methods than the
container_of macro or the pointer is stored in a location not scanned
by kmemleak. If the "member" argument in the offsetof(type, member)
call is not constant, kmemleak considers the offset as zero since it
cannot be determined at compilation time.

Page allocations and ioremap are not tracked. Only the ARM, i386 and sh
architectures are currently supported.


Kmemleak API
------------

See the include/linux/memleak.h header for the functions prototype.

memleak_init - initialize kmemleak
memleak_alloc - notify of a memory block allocation
memleak_free - notify of a memory block freeing
memleak_padding - mark the boundaries of the data inside the block
memleak_not_leak - mark a pointer as not a leak
memleak_ignore - do not scan or report a pointer as leak
memleak_scan_area - add scan areas inside a memory block
memleak_insert_aliases - add aliases for a given type
memleak_erase - erase an old value in a pointer variable
memleak_typeid_raw - set the typeid for an allocated block
memleak_container - statically declare a pointer alias
memleak_typeid - set the typeid for an allocated block (takes
 a type rather than typeid as argument)


Dealing with false positives/negatives
--------------------------------------

To reduce the false negatives, kmemleak provides the memleak_ignore,
memleak_scan_area and memleak_erase functions. The task stacks also
increase the amount of false negatives and their scanning is not
enabled by default.

To eliminate the false positives caused by code allocating a different
size from the object one (either for alignment or for extra memory
after the end of the structure), kmemleak provides the memleak_padding
and memleak_typeid functions.

For pointers known not to be leaks, kmemleak provides the
memleak_not_leak function. The memleak_ignore could also be used if
the memory block is known not to contain other pointers as it will no
longer be scanned.
