config STM_DMA
	bool "STMicroelectronics DMA API"
	select SH_DMA_API
	default y
	---help---
	  Selecting this option will provide support for STMicroelectronics'
	  custom DMA API. This API provides support for data transfers of
	  various dimensions and complex linked list operations. In addition
	  to these free-running operations it also allows management of the
	  paced-transfer peripherals on recent STM parts.

	  On STb710x and STx7200 DMA support is vital for the correct operation of the
	  sound system.

	  If you have a device from STMicroelectronics, then say Y here.
	  Otherwise say N.

	---help---
        Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
        master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
        which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
        Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
        control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
        code to be downloaded onto them and executed.
        Adding in the command line the following string:
        coprocessor_mem=[offset]:size0[,size1][,size2]...
        where:
        offset defines where the co-processors region starts.
               It's an offset from ST40 RAM start.
        size{n} defines the region size for the n.th slave core (max 16M).

        Example: coprocessor_mem=32m:16m,16m

        bool "STM coprocessor debug"

        Enable this option to print out information about the slave CPUs
        addresses and operations you are using for coprocessor.

config STM_RNG
       depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_ST40
       bool "STM Random Number Generator Support"
       default y
       ---help---
         This option adds support for the hardware Random Number Generator
          (RNG) present on the STx71xx and STx7200 SoCs.  It allows the
         RNG to feed /dev/random with entropy thereby ensuring real
         random numbers from this device.

         Without this option, /dev/random has little entropy and is not
         useful.  In fact, it may block for a long time while waiting for
         entropy.

         This option should always be enabled for the STx71xx and STx7200
         SoCs.

          This option can be used in conjunction with the /dev/hw_random
          driver found in the char drivers menu.
