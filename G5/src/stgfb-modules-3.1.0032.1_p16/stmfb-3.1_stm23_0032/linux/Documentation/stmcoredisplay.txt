What is stmcoredisplay?
=======================

This is a display pipeline driver for certain STMicroelectronics SoCs. The
following chips are supported:

(o) STx7100 Cut3.x
(o) STx7109 Cut2/Cut3.x
(o) STi7200 Cut2
(o) STi7111
(o) STx7141
(o) STi7105
(o) STx5202

The driver constructs a number of platform devices to represent the display
pipelines available in the system. Other drivers, such as the stmfb framebuffer,
can register platform drivers to use the display, or get direct access to the
underlying core display API. 

How to use it?
==============

Simply modprobe the core driver module required. If you regularly change the
chip type in your board then you can set up an /etc/modprobe.conf rule to load
all the modules you might need and only one will succeed, e.g.

install stmcore-display \
  _CPU=`grep 'cpu type' < /proc/cpuinfo | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | tr -c -d 0-9` ; \
  _CUT=`grep 'cut' < /proc/cpuinfo | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | cut -b 1` ; \
  echo "running /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install stmcore-display-st[ix]${_CPU}c${_CUT} || stmcore-display-st[ix]${_CPU}" ; \
  /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install stmcore-display-sti${_CPU}c${_CUT} || \
  /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install stmcore-display-stx${_CPU}c${_CUT} || \
  /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install stmcore-display-sti${_CPU} || \
  /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install stmcore-display-stx${_CPU}

install stmfb-automatic \
  _BOARD=`grep 'machine' < /proc/cpuinfo | cut -d ' ' -f 2` ; \
  _CPU=`grep 'cpu type' < /proc/cpuinfo | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | tr -c -d 0-9` ; \
  _CUT=`grep 'cut' < /proc/cpuinfo | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | cut -b 1` ; \
  \
  _AWG=component_${_CPU}c${_CUT}_${_BOARD}.fw ; \
  [ -f /lib/firmware/${_AWG} ] || _AWG=component_${_CPU}c${_CUT}.fw ; \
  [ -f /lib/firmware/${_AWG} ] || _AWG=component_${_CPU}_${_BOARD}.fw ; \
  [ -f /lib/firmware/${_AWG} ] || _AWG=component_${_CPU}.fw ; \
  echo using ${_AWG} ; \
  ln -sf ${_AWG} /lib/firmware/component.fw ; \
  \
  /sbin/modprobe stmcore-display; \
  /sbin/modprobe stmfb ; \
  [ x$BOARD = xhdk7108 ] && i2cset -y 1 0x4a 0x00 0x03 || true ; \
  [ x$BOARD = xhdk7108 ] && i2cset -y 1 0x4a 0x01 0x00 || true

alias fb0 stmfb-automatic


alternatively:
--------------
install stmcore-display \
  /sbin/modprobe stmcore-display-stx7100; \
  /sbin/modprobe stmcore-display-stx7109c3; \
  /bin/true
  
install stmfb-automatic \
  /sbin/modprobe stmcore-display; \
  /sbin/modprobe stmfb
  
alias fb0 stmfb-automatic


The former will dynamically select the correct firmware(**) files to be used to
generate horizontal and vertical sync signals on the component analogue
YPbPr output in ED and HD display modes. These are potentially different on
each SoC and even each board, depending on the SoC hardware and the video signal
output path design of the board. The scripting is convenient if you switch 
boards often; but if you only use a single board, you can just copy the
appropriate component firmware file to /lib/firmware/component.fw and remove the
scripting.

If the driver cannot find /lib/firmware/component.fw, it will give a warning 
on the console, but this does not mean the driver will not work. The composite
and S-Video standard definition outputs, HDMI and DVO will still work as
expected. Also, component YPrPb or RGB (for SCART) output from the HD DACs will
work when the display is configured for PAL/SECAM or NTSC.

(**) The 7100/7109 SoCs do not require a firmware for SMPTE defined ED and HD
modes. They would require a firmware for Australian AS4933 modes, but these
are not supported by this driver.

Module Parameters
=================
The core driver has a single module paramter named hdmi0, its parameter string
has the form:

paramstring := e[nable] | E[NABLE] | d[isable] | D[ISABLE]

The default behaviour, if no parameter is given, is for HDMI output to be
enabled once a valid display mode is requested, for instance by loading the
framebuffer module. However for some applications it may be desirable to keep
HDMI disabled until the application has had a chance to inspect the sink's EDID.

e.g. one could add the following to your modprobe configuration file:

option stmcore-display-stx7109c3 hdmi0=disable

Sysfs
=====

The core driver creates a new class device "stmcoredisplay", which appears
in /sys/class. Under this a class device for each display pipeline available, 
which appears as /sys/class/stmcoredisplay/displayN, is created. Each pipeline
has an "info" attribute which, when read, produces a human readable description
of the pipeline's capabilities. 

If the pipeline has a HDMI output then a second class device appears as
/sys/class/stmcoredisplay/displayN/hdmiN.0 . This contains a number of
attributes which can be inspected to see the state of the device and the
capabilities of a hotplugged sink device. Although most of these are intended
as human readable for troubleshooting purposes, some including the pollable
hotplug attribute may be of use to applications. The full list of attributes
is:

aspect:
  The reported aspect ratio of a connected display, "4_3", "16_9" or "UNKNOWN".

audio_capabilities:
  A list of audio formats (newline separated) reported as supported by the sink,
  including number of channels, sample frequencies, bitdepths, maximum bit
  rates and WMA profile numbers where appropriate. The following example is
  taken from a commercial AV receiver:

 "1:LPCM:8ch:32KHz:44.1KHz:48KHz:88.2KHz:96KHz:176.4KHz:192KHz:16bit:20bit:24bit
  2:AC3:6ch:32KHz:44.1KHz:48KHz:640kbps
  7:DTS:7ch:32KHz:44.1KHz:48KHz:88.2KHz:96KHz:1536kbps
  9:One Bit Audio:6ch:44.1KHz
  10:Dolby Digital+:8ch:44.1KHz:48KHz
  11:DTS-HD:8ch:48KHz:96KHz:192KHz
  12:MLP:8ch:48KHz:96KHz:192KHz"

av_latency:
  A list of the AV latencies (newline separated) reported by the sink in the
  form:
   "V: progressive video latency
    A: progressive audio latency
    IV: interlaced video latency
    IA: interlaced audio latency"
    
  Each entry after the colon is either "Unknown", "No output" or a numeric 
  value in milliseconds.

cea861_codes:
  A list of CEA-861 mode numbers, one per line, supported by the connected
  display that can be generated by the driver on this specific SoC. If a mode
  is marked as "native" by the sink, an asterix will appear after the mode
  number.

cec_address:
  the sink provided CEC address for this device in the form "a.b.c.d"

color_format:
  A list of colour formats and bitdepths supported by the sink. Each format
  supported "RGB", "YUV422" and "YUV444" is listed on a new line, followed by a
  colon separated list of the bitdepths available in that format, e.g:
    "RGB:24:30:36
     YUV422:24
     YUV444:24"

  would indicate a sink that support up to 36bit deepcolour in RGB but only
  standard 24bit colour in YUV formats.

colorgamut_profiles:
  A colon separated numeric list of supported color gamut profile levels
  supported by the sink or the string "none".

colorspaces:
  A colon separated list of strings indicating the colourspaces supported by
  the sink. The full list of possible colorspaces is:

    "sRGB:Ycc601:Ycc709:xvYcc601:xvYcc709:sYcc601:AdobeYcc601:AdobeRGB"

  Please see CEA-861-E and the definition of the CEA extension block and
  colorimetry data block for full details.

dev:
  The major and minor numbers of the /dev/hdmiN.0 device node, usually created
  by udev. Note that this attribute is generated automatically by the Linux
  device framework.

hotplug:
  Indicates if a device has been hotplugged, returning either "y" or "n". This
  attribute is pollable, allowing an application thread to block waiting for
  the hotplug status to change.

name:
  The sink's reported device name or:
    - "UNKNOWN" if no device is connected;
    - "SAFEMODE" if the sink's EDID could not be read or was corrupt.

modes:
  List the display modes (one per line) supported by the sink and that can be
  generated by the driver on this specific SoC, in the form:

   {S|U}:<Width>x<Height>{p|i}-<VerticalRefresh>

  e.g. "S:1280x720p-59" indicates support for the CEA Standard (S) 720p@59.94HZ.
  The vertical refresh rate is rounded down to the nearest integer.

speaker_allocation:
  Colon separated list of surround sound speaker channels supported, the full
  list is:
    "FL/FR:LFE:FC:RL/RR:RC:FLC/FRC:RLC/RRC:FLW/FRW:FLH/FRH:TC:FCH"

supports_ai:
  indicates if the sink has the "supports_ai" bit set in the HDMI VSDB
  (See HDMI Specification v1.3a for details), returns "y" or "n".

tmds_status:
  either the string "Running" or "Stopped" to indicate if the TDMS PHY is
  transmitting a signal or not.

type:
  The type of display connected, "DVI", "HDMI" or "INVALID" if no device is
  connected.

underscan:
  indicates the CEA and VCDB scanmode behaviour of the sink, one line for each
  in the form:
    "CEA:CEAScan
     VCDB:CEScan:ITScan:PTScan"

     where CEAScan can be "Underscanned" or "Overscanned",

     CEScan and ITScan can be:
       "Unsupported","Overscanned","Underscanned" or "Selectable"
     and PTScan can be:
       "Undefined","Overscanned","Underscanned" or "Selectable"

   Please see CEA-861-E and the definition of the CEA extension block
   and VCDB for full details.

quantization_control:
  Indicates which if any of the AVI info frame quantization range flags are
  supported by the sink, the possible results are:
    "Unsupported", "RGB", "YCC" or "RGB:YCC".

  Please see CEA-861-E and the definition of the VCDB for full details.


HDMI Character Device
=====================

A character device is created for each display pipeline that has a HDMI 
serializer. The device major/minor can be obtained from reading the
/sys/class/stmcoredisplay/displayN/hdmiN.0/dev attribute. On a udev system
the devices should appear automatically as /dev/hdmiN.0 . Reading from the
device returns the full 32k extended EDID blocks read from a connected
display. If no display is connected, a read will result in EOF. Displays are
unlikely to use the full space available, in fact most TVs still only use the 
first two blocks, in which case the unused blocks will contain all zeros.

The device supports the following IOCTLS, whose definitions can be found in
/usr/include/linux/stm/hdmi.h on the target filesystem if the 
stlinux23-sh4-stmfb-headers RPM has been installed.

STMHDMIIO_FLUSH_DATA_PACKET_QUEUE:
  Flush data queued for transmission by STMHDMIIO_SEND_DATA_PACKET and
  STMHDMIIO_SET_ISRC_DATA.

STMHDMIIO_SEND_DATA_PACKET:
  Queue a HDMI data packet for transmission; used to send ACP, profile 0 colour
  gamut, vendor specific info frames and NTSC VBI info frames. See the type
  definition of "struct stmhdmiio_data_packet" in the header file for full
  details of how to use this interface.

STMHDMIIO_SET_AUDIO_DATA:
  Set the channel count, speaker configuration and downmix information for
  audio info frames. See the definition of the parameter argument type
  "struct stmhdmiio_audio" in the header file for full details.

STMHDMIIO_SET_AUDIO_SOURCE:
  Set which audio source should be routed to the HDMI output, 2ch PCM, 8ch PCM
  or SPDIF. All options may not be available on every SoC depending on the
  hardware configuration.

STMHDMIIO_SET_AUDIO_TYPE:
  Set the audio type being routed to the HDMI output, the options being:
    - LPCM or IEC61937 compressed audio at <192KHz (e.g. AC3)
    - 1-bit audio (SACD)
    - Compressed DSD
    - Double Rate DSD
    - High bit rate (HBR) compressed audio (e.g. DTS-HD Master Audio)

STMHDMIIO_SET_AVMUTE:
  Send a General Control Packet (GCP) on the next frame to set or clear the
  AVMUTE state in the sink. This takes a numeric argument which is treated as a
  boolean, i.e. 0 sends a clear AVMute command and non-zero sends a set AVMute
  command. Note that only one GCP is sent unless in a deepcolor configuration,
  in which case due to a hardware limitation a GCP with the last configured
  AVMute command will be sent every frame along with the deepcolor state.

STMHDMIIO_SET_ISRC_DATA:
  Queue ISRC data for transmission. See the type definition of
  "struct stmhdmiio_isrc_data" in the header file for full details on how to
  use this interface.

STMHDMIIO_SET_CEA_MODE_SELECTION:
  Each display mode has a CEA mode number which is sent in the AVI info frame.
  However display timings that support different picture aspect ratios (16:9 or
  4:3) simply by redefining the pixel aspect ratio, indicate which aspect ratio
  is in use by changing the CEA mode number. The HDMI device can be configured
  with this IOCTL to determines which CEA mode number to use in different ways.
  See the type definition of "stmhdmiio_cea_mode_selection_t" in the header
  file for full details.

STMHDMIIO_SET_CONTENT_TYPE:
  Set the type of content being displayed, i.e. CE, IT, graphics, photo etc.
  See the type "stmhdmiio_content_type_t" in the header file for all options.
  This is used to fill in the ITC and CN fields in the AVI info frame.

STMHDMIIO_SET_EDID_MODE_HANDLING:
  By default the HDMI device driver will not enable the TMDS output if the
  current display standard is not supported by the sink (determined from its
  EDID information). This prevents the driver from ever knowingly sending a
  TMDS clock that is out of range, a behaviour which meets the various
  specifications. However a lot of TVs support modes not advertised in their
  EDID, e.g. they might advertise 720p@50Hz but not 720p@60Hz even though they
  can actually support both refresh rates. By using this IOCTL an application
  can bypass the default strict behaviour (see "stmhdmiio_edid_mode_t" in the
  header file) and force the output of all display modes. However ST has no
  liability if the use of this option damages your customer's equipment.

STMHDMIIO_SET_HOTPLUG_MODE:
  Change the HDMI device behaviour when a hotplug event is detected, while the
  TMDS output is running. See the type definition for "stmhdmiio_hpd_mode_t"
  in the header file for full details.

STMHDMIIO_SET_OVERSCAN_MODE:
  Select if the current display content is designed to be overscanned, 
  underscanned or if this is unknown. This information is used to construct
  the scan information in the AVI info frame.

STMHDMIIO_SET_SAFE_MODE_PROTOCOL:
  If the HDMI device is unable to read a valid EDID from a hotplugged sink,
  it will fall back to a safemode as described in CEA-861-E Annex F.3.5. The
  default behaviour is to assume the sink is DVI not HDMI capable. However this
  IOCTL allow the application to override this and allow the HDMI protocols to
  be sent, which includes data island packets, e.g. info frames and audio.

STMHDMIIO_SET_SPD_DATA:
  Set the Source Product Descriptor contents, which are sent to a connected sink
  approximately once every half second automatically by the driver.
  See CEA-861-E for details of the values to be sent. Also see the defintion of
  the argument type "stmhdmiio_spd" in the header file.

Note that a number of these parameters can be accessed using the "hdmi-control"
application, installed by the stlinux23-sh4-stmfb-utils RPM.

Driver Writers
==============
Driver writers should look at "linux/include/linux/stm/stmcoredisplay.h"
and "include/stmdisplay*.h" for details of the platform device and core driver
API respectively. However in brief a driver wishing to utilize a display
pipeline has two options, firstly it can register a platform driver for the
device id "stmcore-display". The driver will get probed once for each display
pipeline available. The probe callback gets a platform device pointer passed
to it, which contains platform data describing the pipeline, that can be
retrieved as follows:

#include <linux/stm/stmcoredisplay.h>

...

static int probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
    struct stmcore_display_pipeline_data *pd;

    pd = *((struct stmcore_display_pipeline_data **)pdev->dev.platform_data);

This is the mechanism currently used by the supplied framebuffer driver. If the
framebuffer is used in your system (likely) then other clients of the core
driver probably do not want to register as a platform driver as (a) the linux
management is likely to get confused by having two drivers for the same platform
device and (b) the framebuffer will have stored private data in the platform
device structure which should not be changed.

So there is a second, direct method to get hold of a display pipeline's
platform data, using the exported function:

int stmcore_get_display_pipeline(int pipeline,
                                 struct stmcore_display_pipeline_data *data)
                                 
This returns a shallow copy of the platform data, into a buffer provided by the
caller, for the requested pipeline (numbered starting from 0). If the requested
pipeline does not exist then this function returns -ENODEV.

In the platform driver case it is necessary to obtain a reference to the core
driver module, using for example:

  if(!try_module_get(pd->owner))
    return -ENODEV;

to prevent the core driver module from being unloaded while in use. If you
use the exported module function then this isn't necessary, but it does no
harm, as there is an explicit dependency generated by the use of the exported
symbol. If a module reference is obtained then please remember to do a
module_put(pd->owner) to release the reference once your driver has finished
with the display pipeline.
