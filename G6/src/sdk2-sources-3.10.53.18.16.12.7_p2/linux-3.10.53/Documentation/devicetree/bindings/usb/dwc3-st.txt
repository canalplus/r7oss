ST DWC3 glue logic

This file documents the parameters for the dwc3-st driver
This driver provides the glue logic to use the dwc3 on STiH407 platforms based.

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "st,stih407-dwc3"
 - reg		: glue logic base address and USB syscfg ctrl register offest
 - reg-names	: register names.
 - st,syscon    : should be phandle to system configuration node which
		  encompases this glue registers.
 - resets       : phandle pointing to the system reset controller
 - #address-cells : must be <1>
 - pinctrl-0	: Pin control group

Optional properties:
 - st,dwc3-drd-device: to program the HC as "device" (static setup)

The DWC3 is a subnode to DWC3 core driver as shown below.
Take a look at Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc3.txt

Example:

st_dwc3: dwc3@8f94000 {
	status		= "disabled";
	compatible	= "st,stih407-dwc3";
	reg		= <0x08f94000 0x1000>, <0x110 0x4>;
	reg-names	= "reg-glue", "syscfg-reg";
	st,syscfg	= <&syscfg_core>;
	resets          = <&powerdown STIH407_USB3_POWERDOWN>;
	#address-cells	= <1>;
	#size-cells	= <1>;
	pinctrl-names	= "default";
	pinctrl-0	= <&pinctrl_usb3>;
	ranges;

	dwc3: dwc3@9900000 {
		compatible	= "synopsys,dwc3";
		reg		= <0x09900000 0x100000>;
		interrupts	=  <GIC_SPI 155 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;

		/* usb2 picophy port2, MiPHY2 port for USB3 */
		phys = <&usb3_picophy>;
		phy-names = "usb2-phy";

		usb3-phy = <&usb3_phy>;
	};
};
