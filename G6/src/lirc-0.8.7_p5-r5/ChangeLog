	support usb-uirt on FreeBSD

	From: John Wehle <john@feith.com>

	The enclosed lightly tested patch allows lirc to build on FreeBSD 8.1
	and talk to an usb-uirt.  Note that the FreeBSD uftdi driver module
	needs to be patch in order to recognize the usb-uirt.  The necessary
	changes are logged with the FreeBSD bugs database as usb/149900.

	Changes:

	 1) Include <netinet/in.h> when compiling irsend.c.

	 2) Include <sys/ioctl.h> when compiling lircd.c.  For simplicity you
	    may want to included it on all platforms rather than using the
	    current conditional include.

	 3) Mark uinputfd stuff in lircmd.c as specific to linux.  I used the
	    same approach as had already been done for the uinputfd stuff in
	    lircd.c.

	 4) Normalize tv in hw_uirt2_common.c mywaitfordata to avoid an
	    EINVAL when calling select.  I used the same approach as had
	    already been done elsewhere in the code.

	 5) Also set the character size and hardware handshaking when setting
	    up the serial port for the usb-uirt.

	daemon: quiet spurious serial invalid lock complaints

	From: John Wehle <john@feith.com>

	The enclosed lightly tested patch quiets some spurious serial invalid
	lock complaints which occur on FreeBSD 8.1.

	Changes:

	 1) Skip "." and ".." when looking for locks.

	 2) Requiring the pid in the lock file to be newline terminated is
	    overly strict ... treat it as valid if it's the only thing in
	    the file or if it's newline terminated.

	lirc_mceusb: override bInterval on topseed 0x0008 to 1

	Complete and total testing involves actually yanking the device out

	topseed 0x0008 device comes up like so:

	usb 2-9: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 endpoint 0x1 has an invalid bInterval 0, changing to 32
	usb 2-9: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 endpoint 0x82 has an invalid bInterval 0, changing to 32

	If we load the old lirc_mceusb, that got set to 1. Unload and load up an
	updated lirc_mceusb to enable transmit, and it sticks at 1. Unplug and
	replug with the updated driver and its back at 32, and the thing gets
	completely wedged.

	Upon inspection, the topseed 0x0001 and original ms mce transceiver also
	come up with a stock bInterval of 0, so we're back to setting it to 1 for
	everything but the pinnacle transceiver, where whatever its default is
	seems to be required for functionality. Meh.

	lirc_mceusb: enable transmit on topseed 0x0008 devices

	Special thanks to Greg Oliver for providing the hardware to
	debug and figure out the proper intialization sequence for
	this device.

	Essentially, there seems to be a 3rd-gen class of mceusb devices,
	which require different initialization from the 2nd-gen (and 1st-gen),
	so I've created a new device table for those.

	There's a quirk with a note about a usb reset being required for the
	pinnacle device... That reset actually wedges the topseed 0x0008,
	and the required magic for it is actually to send the mce device
	reset command to the device prior to starting the init sequence. I
	*suspect* this would also work in place of the crap being done for
	the pinnacle device right now, but I don't have one to test that theory
	out, so I'm leaving it be for now...

	Nb: in the future, the multitude of tables here and in the imon driver
	should be converted to device quirk tables, a la the upstream firewire
	driver... (first example that comes to mind).

	I've been sitting on a post from a Kevin Timmerman to
	gmane.comp.hardware.lirc from back in early 2007 that details
	a bunch of the mce device command strings and their meanings.
	Transcribe that into comments in the code and give the various
	strings more descriptive names. For example, 'pin_init1' is
	actually 'get carrier mode and frequency'.

	More detailed debugging spew that also utilizes this data soon
	to follow...

	* drivers/lirc_mceusb/lirc_mceusb.c:
	lirc_mceusb: refactor packet request handler

	First up, support for async inbound data was pointless, it only got
	used by the init sequences, which are actually better served by sync
	requests, so simplify that.

	Second, request_packet_async was never really a proper name, since its
	both generic and wrong (supports sync reqs too), so rename it to
	mce_request_packet.

	Third, add wrappers for inbound and outbound requests to reduce a ton

	lirc_imon: add a 3rd IR "protocol", which is iMON w/o pad stabilize

	Now with ir_protocol=2, you get the native iMON IR protocol, without
	the pad stabilization function, which should make life easier for those
	who want to use a universal remote trained from their iMON remote.

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: add support for setting/enabling iMON internal clock via sysfs

	lcdproc can be used to set the clock on an iMON device, but it can now
	also be done by simply directing 'date' output into a sysfs attr.

	To show a clock on your iMON device do the following:
	    # date "+%y %m %d %w %H %M %S" > /sys/.../imon_clock

	Requires that the display is of course present on your device, and that
	it isn't currently open (by something like lcdproc's LCDd).

	Tested successfully on a 15c2:ffdc VFD and 15c2:0045 LCD.

	Patch primarily by Vitaly V. Bursov, I just added the bits to make it
	work for the LCD devices too.

	* NEWS: Enhance summary of iMON changes made for 0.8.6 in NEWS

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: minor clarification to functionality of nomouse param

	What we're really doing is disabling the mouse/keyboard toggle button,
	so that when an IR client is attached, we're always in keyboard mode,
	but if no IR client is attached, the mouse device is still enabled.

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: add support to disable mouse mode via a modparam

	In certain use cases, mouse mode isn't really helpful, and could
	actually cause confusion, so allow disabling the toggle button.

	Most notably, mouse mode doesn't make sense for mythtv users, since
	mythtv hides the cursor by default and most of its UI doesn't accept
	mouse click input.

	lirc_imon: fix right-click mouse button via input on newer imon devices

	Fix courtesy of Rene Harder via lirc list, I just added the bit to
	keep right-click working on the older devices.

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: support setting IR protocol for either iMON or MCE/RC6 remotes

	Devices that do onboard decoding can be told to listen for either the iMON
	remote(s) or Windows Media Center Edition remotes (which use the RC-6 proto).

	Note that this addition further simplifies some setup code, as all
	devices now have a reason to need a tx urb, so we just wire it up
	unconditionally. Proto can either be specified at module load time, or
	changed on the fly by poking /sys/modules/lirc_imon/parameters/ir_protocol,
	then closing and re-opening the IR device (connecting a new IR client).

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: support mouse and touch input devices even when IR isn't open

	If we simply move urb setup and teardown into imon_probe() and
	imon_disconnect(), we can use the mouse and touch input devices
	without having to have an IR client listening. Also fixes up the
	suspend/resume routines so they should work better.

	Based heavily on patch by Rene Harder that followed our discussion
	on the lirc list about doing this.

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c: lirc_imon: touchscreen handling fixups

	Based on feedback and initial patch from Rene Harder, fix up
	the touchscreen handling a bit.

	1) Down-sampling of the touch matrix for the smaller touchscreen wasn't
	kicking in, though we never got to that point anyway...

	2) We never stuck around long enough to send touch data to lirc (we were
	bailing after sending it via input subsys only, we want both options).

	3) Within touch handler, NULL check was incorrect (s/mouse/touch/).

	4) Check for touch presses before mouse input, with a check for len,
	so we can filter between the two better, lest some presses get
	crossed up.

	5) for newer devices (ones that could potentially have a touch screen),
	improve filtering of touchscreen vs. d-pad mouse input (mouse input
	always has len == 5).

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: make mouse support actually work in the older devices

	The older gen imon devices decode mouse buttons and pad presses
	completely differently than newer devices. Getting messy, but I
	think this should do it... Pad is behaving on an ffdc imon knob,
	will get mouse buttons tested tomorrow (working with an ffdc
	device about 200 miles away from me at my brother's place. :)

	and knobs no longer working, so we'll just enable 'em every time
	we load up the driver.

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: add mouse and touchscreen input device support

	Add an input device for the iMON PAD remote in mouse mode, and
	on supported devices, a touchscreen input device. Also based
	heavily on Rene Harder's iMON Touch patch submitted to the lirc
	mailing list back in Nov. '08, but adapted to benefit all the
	recent iMON devices.

	Nb: does NOT yet work with the older ffdc devices, but it
	shouldn't be terribly difficult to add support once I find
	a guinea pig...

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	lirc_imon: support dual-interface device with a single lirc device

	Recent iMON devices have dual usb interfaces, and up until now, lirc
	configures them as two separate lirc devices, which must then be
	bound together in userspace to function properly. Its pretty much
	the opposite of user-friendly. These changes are based in no small
	part on a patch submitted to the lirc mailing list back in Nov. '08
	by Rene Harder, but benefit all recent iMON devices, instead of just
	the Touch devices.

	Tested reasonably rigorously with the Antec-branded 0045 device I've
	got here.

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:
	The Windows drivers contain 6 different inf files, more or less one for
	each new device until the 0x0034-0x0046 devices, which all use the same
	driver. Some of the devices in the 34-46 range haven't been definitively
	identified yet, but we know they exist or are in the works, based on a
	look at 'strings Setup/data1.hdr |grep 15c2' in the Windows driver zip.

	Will need help from users and/or SoundGraph to fill in the blanks...

	* drivers/lirc_imon/lirc_imon.c:

	The remote which is described in German including a picture under
	http://www.pearl.de/product.jsp?pdid=PE4444&catid=5005&rate=5
	has some mouse movement keys. These and the corresponding mouse buttons have

	* drivers/lirc_dev/lirc_dev.c, drivers/lirc_dev/lirc_dev.h, drivers/lirc_serial/lirc_serial.c:
	- lirc_dev:
		- Introduces 'struct lirc_buffer' and functions to handle it.
			- Moves the lock and wait queue to 'struct lirc_buffer'.
			- Locking happens implicitly on lirc_buffer_[read!write]_1.
			- The caller is responsible of locking on
			  _lirc_buffer_[read!write]_1
		- Plugins can provide an 'struct lirc_buffer' for reading.
		- Remove 'struct irctl'->bytes_in_key in favor of 'struct
		  lirc_buffer'->chunk_size.
		- Extends lirc_dev's irctl_read and irctl_poll to acomodate lirc_serial.

	- lirc_serial:
		- Integrates lirc_serial with the above, removing lirc_poll and
		  lirc_read.

	- Move features into 'struct lirc_plugin' to allow the plugins to specify it's
	  features.
	- Add an 'ioctl' function pointer to 'struct lirc_plugin' so plugins have a
	  chance to handle ioctl's before the general cases are handled.
	- Extend the lirc_dev's ioctl handling to be more generic so it meets
	  lirc_serial's needs.
	- Make lirc_serial take advantage of lirc_dev's new capabilities.
	- Make all other drivers fit with lirc_dev's changes.

	- Renamed calc_pulse_lengths_in_clocks into init_timing_params and wrote one
